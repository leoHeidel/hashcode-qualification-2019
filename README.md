# hashcode-qualification-2019
A greedy algorithm coded in python that got us qualified to the final round

## Algorithm
The idea behind this algorithm is simply to take the next best slide.

## Disclaimer 
We did not make any modifications after the 4-hour qualification round, which is why we make no guarantee over the quality of the code :) .
